***WELCOME TO READ-ME***


Description:-

    This project is a music player. You can listen to audio files by adding .mp3 and .wav audio files. You can create playlists, toggle
    between shuffle and repeat playlist options, increase or decrease volume, remove audio files, and can do many other things which a
    music player can do.


How it works:-

    As you run the program, it shows a basic user interface with options. These options are:
        Play/Pause
        Next
        Previous
        Shuffle
        Repeat
        Add/Remove audio files
        Create/Remove a playlist
        Add/Remove audio files to/from a playlist
    
    When you open the program, there are no audio files. Thus, you have to select the "Add New Song" option and add audio file one at a
    time from your system.
    
    Then you can double click on the audio file you want to play. Otherwise, if you click the Play/Pause button, it will play the very
    first audio file in the list.
    
    You can then do other things like create a playlist, remove audio file, remove an existing playlist, add an audio file to the
    playlist, etc.
    
    If you choose the "Create Playlist" option, it will make an empty playlist. Then you have to select that playlist and select the
    "Add Song To Playlist" option to add existing audio files to the created/selected playlist.
    
    Similarly, you can do more other things in this program, just as you do in any other music player.
    
    This is the entirety of Music World! It functions properly, allowing you to enjoy your music.


Trials and Tribulations:-

    We had difficulty implementing the pop-up menus for creating/removing playlists and adding/removing a song to/from a playlist. We
    also had difficulty implementing the progress bar. Our UML was semi-difficult.
    
    We have used two design patterns:
        Factory Design Pattern
        Composite Design Pattern


Special Libraries Used:-
    
    NAudio
    TagLib-Sharp
    
    
Bugs and Future plans:-

    There is a bug in the progress bar. It is not fully implemented. We have 90% of the logic ready but the last 10% is not implemented
    yet. Two other features that are not implemented are the current duration, and the audio art.
    
    For future, we are planning to have non-implemented things to be working properly.
    
    Our future plans for this project include a better user interface, importing personalized playlists from iTunes, an equalizer, a
    visualizer, a timer, and more audio extensions.
